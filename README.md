<h1>Image Processing API</h1>
**1. Image Upload**: Allow users to upload images, validate formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG), and resize/compress as
needed.

**2. Image Resizing**: Resize images while maintaining aspect ratio, useful for mobile apps/web pages.

**3. Image Filtering**: Apply filters like:
        * Grayscale conversion
        * Blur
        * Sharpen
        * Emboss
        * Edge detection

**4. Object Detection**: Identify specific objects within images using algorithms like Haar cascades or YOLO.

**5. Image Enhancement**: Enhance image quality with features like:
        * Denoising (removing noise from low-light/noisy images)
        * Sharpening (enhancing details and contrast)
        * Color correction (adjusting color temperature/saturation)

**6. Text Recognition**: Extract text from images using OCR algorithms.

**7. Image Comparison**: Compare two images, identifying similarities/differences for tasks like image
authentication/tampering detection.

**8. Thumbnail Generation**: Automatically generate thumbnails of uploaded images with adjustable sizes/formats.

**9. Metadata Extraction**: Extract metadata (camera info, timestamps, etc.) or IPTC data from images.
